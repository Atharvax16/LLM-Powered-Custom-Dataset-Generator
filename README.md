# LLM-Powered-Custom-Dataset-Generator
# LLM-Powered Custom Dataset Generator  This project is an intelligent dataset generation assistant powered by an LLM (Large Language Model). Users can describe the kind of dataset they need in plain English — specifying columns, data types, and constraints — and the tool generates structured specifications and synthetic data accordingly.
